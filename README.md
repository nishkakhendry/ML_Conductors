# ML_Conductors

Data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nomad2018-predict-transparent-conductors).

## Notes

- the magnitude of each vector (in the xyz file) is the `lattice_vector_1_ang` and so on. Magnitude refers to the vector length
- the lattice vectors span the entire stuctures give, so they are a primitive unit of the crystal lattices they form
